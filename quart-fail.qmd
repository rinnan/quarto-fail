## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

# Deploy a quarto doc containing the following code
# More steps on following slide
# What do you learn when it fails?
```{r}
f <-- function() g()
g <-- function() h()
h <-- function() i()
i <-- function() stop("Error")
```

```{r}
f()
```
